    "## 2.0 Second Implementation: Red Black Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "[Red Black Trees Explanation](https://medium.com/basecs/painting-nodes-black-with-red-black-trees-60eacb2be9a5)\n",
    "\n",
    "> A red-black tree is a type of self-balancing binary search tree, very similar to other self-balancing trees, such as AVL trees. However, a red-black tree is a structure that has to adhere to a very strict set of rules in order to make sure that it stays balanced; the rules of a red-black tree are exactly what enables it to maintain a guaranteed logarithmic time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Every single node in the tree must be either red or black.\n",
    "2. The root node of the tree must always be black.\n",
    "3. Two red nodes can never appear consecutively, one after another; a red node must always be preceded by a black node (it must have a black parent node), and a red node must always have black children nodes.\n",
    "4. Every branch path — the path from a root node to an empty (null) leaf node — must pass through the exact same number of black nodes. A branch path from the root to an empty leaf node is also known as an unsuccessful search path, since it represents the path we would take if we were to search for a node that didn’t exist within the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "[*Why Red Black Trees?*](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13852870/red-black-tree-over-avl-tree)\n",
    "\n",
    "> Both red-black trees and AVL trees are the most commonly used balanced binary search trees and they support insertion, deletion and look-up in guaranteed O(logN) time. However, there are following points of comparison between the two:\n",
    "\n",
    "> AVL trees are more rigidly balanced and hence provide faster look-ups. Thus for a look-up intensive task use an AVL tree.\n",
    "For an insert intensive tasks, use a Red-Black tree.\n",
    "AVL trees store the balance factor at each node. This takes O(N) extra space. However, if we know that the keys that will be inserted in the tree will always be greater than zero, we can use the sign bit of the keys to store the colour information of a red-black tree. Thus, in such cases red-black tree takes no extra space.\n",
    "What are the application of Red black tree?\n",
    "Red-black trees are more general purpose. They do relatively well on add, remove, and look-up but AVL trees have faster look-ups at the cost of slower add/remove.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes:\n",
    " 1. it’s easiest to start off by always inserting a red node, and then recoloring and rotation as necessary, afterwards\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "2. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17279805/how-do-i-implement-a-hashtable-using-a-binary-search-tree\n",
    "\n",
    "> No, we do not need to calculate an index or use a hashing function. If we store the key,value pairs in the nodes of the bst, then its just a matter of traversing the tree by comparing the keys. This also gives you the added advantage of no collisions since the keys are unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "> You could use a hashing function and hash the key and then traverse the tree based on that value but this can lead to collisions if you are not careful with the hash function and then you would have to maintain some sort of chaining.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Whether to use the key or the hashed value of the key depends on the size of the key. If the key size is large, it makes sense to hash it to a smaller size for faster comparison."
